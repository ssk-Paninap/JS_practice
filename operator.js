let x = 5

// Left shift: Shifts x's bits y positions to the left
//let z = x<<y

// Bitwise AND assignment: Performs AND operation and assigns result to x
//let z = x&=y

// Bitwise XOR assignment: Performs XOR operation and assigns result to x
//let z = x^=y 

// Logical AND assignment: Assigns y to x if x is truthy
//let z = x&&=y

// Logical OR assignment: Assigns y to z if z is falsy
